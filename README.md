NuajFramework
=============

This is my old C# DirectX 10 framework called Nuaj'.
This is NOT the 3D clouds project for Unity, which is also quite confusely called Nuaj'... (why change a great name? ;))

It's not been maintained for more than a year now so don't expect any updates.


Useful infos :
--------------

. Solution and projects were created using VS2010

. Uses .Net framework 3.5

. Uses SharpDX by Alex Mutel (provided in the Externals directory)

. You need install the FBX SDK (http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/index?siteID=123112&id=6837478) (choose at least version 2011.2)
 => you then have to create a environment variable named "FBX_SDK" pointing to the FBX SDK location (i.e. to the directory containing the "lib" and "include" folders)

. Last but not least, you must install the DirectX SDK from June 2010 (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=3021d52b-514e-41d3-ad02-438a3ba730ba)
