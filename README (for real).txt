. Solution and projects were created using VS2010

. You need install the latest FBX SDK (http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/index?siteID=123112&id=6837478) (choose at least version 2011.2)
 => you then have to create a environment variable named "FBX_SDK" pointing to the FBX SDK location (i.e. to the directory containing the "lib" and "include" folders)

. Last but not least, you must install the DirectX SDK from June 2010 (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=3021d52b-514e-41d3-ad02-438a3ba730ba)
